# Welcome onboard to the Cypress Journey

### What is Cypress?
Cypress is a front-end test automation tool designed to simplify the creation of user interface (UI) tests. Unlike other automation tools, such as Selenium, which work outside the browser, Cypress runs directly in the browser, offering a more integrated and agile testing experience.
Cypress is ideal for projects that need a robust testing tool with a fast learning curve and native integration for modern JavaScript applications.

### Installing

You'll need Node.js and npm

* To start the project: `npm init -y`
* To install Cypress: `npm install cypress --save-dev`
* To open Cypress: `npx cypress open`
* If you want to run Cypress in headless mode (without a graphical interface), runs the tests directly in the terminal: `npx cypress run`
